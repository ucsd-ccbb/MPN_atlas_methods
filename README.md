### Summary
While innate immune anti-viral deaminases inhibit viral replication, primate-specific apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide like 3 (APOBEC3) and adenosine deaminase associated with RNA1 (ADAR1) have emerged as key drivers of therapeutic resistance in many malignancies. However, the role of deaminase deregulation in cancer progression has not been clearly elucidated. By performing unbiased whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing analyses of pre-leukemia stem cells (pre-LSC) in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) compared to non-MPN controls and bulk MPN blood cells, we discovered a 4-fold lower mutational burden and depletion of a COSMIC clock-like signature associated with cell division, SBS1, in pre-LSC. Pre-LSC evolution was marked by APOBEC3C elevation, an increased C-to-T mutational burden, and stem cell proliferation, which could be recapitulated by lentiviral APOBEC3C overexpression. In stem and progenitor cells, MPN progression was also associated with pro-inflammatory splice isoform upregulation, anti-viral signaling pathway activation, ADAR1p150 overexpression and AtoI RNA hyper-editing. Generation of LSC in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was associated with ADAR1-mediated STAT3 intronic editing, STAT3b isoform switching, and increased phospho- STAT3 expression, which could be reversed by pharmacologic JAK2/STAT3 inhibition. Lentivirally enforced ADAR1p150 enhanced pre-LSC engraftment and replating in keeping with b-catenin activation, which could be inhibited by lentiviral ADAR1 shRNA knockdown. Thus, early detection and selective targeting of anti-viral deaminase deregulation may represent a tractable strategy for preventing cancer progression.

### Summary
Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) preserves genomic integrity by preventing retroviral integration and retrotransposition during stress responses. However, inflammatory microenvironment-induced ADAR1p110 to p150 splice isoform switching drives cancer stem cell (CSC) generation and therapeutic resistance in 20 malignancies. Previously, predicting and preventing ADAR1p150-mediated malignant RNA editing represented a significant challenge. Thus, we developed lentiviral ADAR1 and splicing reporters for non-invasive detection of splicing-mediated ADAR1 adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing activation; a quantitative ADAR1p150 intracellular flow cytometric assay; a selective small molecule inhibitor of splicing-mediated ADAR1 activation, Rebecsinib, which inhibits leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal and prolongs humanized LSC mouse model survival at doses that spare normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs); and pre-IND studies showing favorable Rebecsinib toxicokinetic and pharmacodynamic (TK/PD) properties. Together, these results lay the foundation for developing Rebecsinib as a clinical ADAR1p150 antagonist aimed at obviating malignant microenvironment-driven LSC generation.
